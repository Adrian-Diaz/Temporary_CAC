dump CAC/xyz command :h3

[Syntax:]

dump ID group-ID CAC/xyz N file args :pre

ID = user-assigned name for the dump
group-ID = ID of the group of atoms/elements to be dumped
CAC/xyz = style of dump command (other styles {atom} or {cfg} or {dcd} or {xtc} or {xyz} or {local} or {custom} are discussed on the "dump"_dump.html doc page)
N = dump every this many timesteps
file = name of file to write dump info to
args = same as arguments for "dump_style custom"_dump.html :ul

[Examples:]

dump mesh all CAC/xyz 1000 CACmesh.txt

[Description:]

Periodically outputs the position of a set of virtual atoms and real atoms for the 
specified group. These virtual atoms are the result of converting a CAC element into 
atomistic resolution through the interpolation fields. The purpose of this is to 
print small regions of a CAC model that may require the use of an atomistic 
diagnostic tool such as OVITO.

IMPORTANT NOTE: CAC elements can be quite large, as a result a conversion to atomistic
resolution may result in a massive amount of data if your group size is not carefully
chosen. Currently you cannot elect to output a piece of a CAC element as virtual atoms,
if an element is included in the group (because its centroid is in the group region etc.)
then all of its material will be converted to virtual atoms and output.

NOTE: Unless the "dump_modify sort"_dump_modify.html option
is invoked, the atoms and finite elements will be written in an indeterminate 
order for each snapshot; nodes and internal degrees of freedom will belong to 
their respective finite element however.
