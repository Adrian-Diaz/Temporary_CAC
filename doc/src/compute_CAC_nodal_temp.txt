compute CAC/nodal_temp command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID temp :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
CAC/nodal_temp = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute 1 all CAC/nodal_temp
compute myTemp mobile CAC/nodal_temp :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the kinetic temperature of a group of
atoms/elements by using their velocities and nodal velocities.
The temperature is calculated by the formula KE = dim/2 N k T, where
KE = total kinetic energy of the group of atoms/elements (sum of 1/2 m v^2),
dim = 2 or 3 = dimensionality of the simulation, N = number of atoms
in the group, k = Boltzmann constant, and T = temperature.

The number of atoms/elements contributing to the temperature is assumed to be
constant for the duration of the run; use the {dynamic} option of the
"compute_modify"_compute_modify.html command if this is not the case.

This compute subtracts out degrees-of-freedom due to fixes that
constrain molecular motion, such as "fix shake"_fix_shake.html and
"fix rigid"_fix_rigid.html.  This means the temperature of groups 
that include these constraints will be computed correctly.  If
needed, the subtracted degrees-of-freedom can be altered using the
{extra} option of the "compute_modify"_compute_modify.html command.

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global scalar (the temperature).
This value can be used by any command that uses a global scalar 
as input. See the "Howto output"_Howto_output.html doc page for
an overview of LAMMPS output options.

The scalar value calculated by this compute is "intensive".
The scalar value will be in temperature "units"_units.html.  

[Restrictions:] 

This compute requires a CAC atom style


[Default:] none
