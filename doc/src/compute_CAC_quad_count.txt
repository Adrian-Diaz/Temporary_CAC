compute CAC/quad_count command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID CAC/quad_count :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
CAC/quad_count = style name of this compute command :ul

[Examples:]

compute Eweight all CAC/quad_count

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the computational weight required
by each atom and finite element in CAC model. This is performed by using
the neighbor list sizes associated with the force computation.

NOTE: The first time this compute is invoked it will simply count the 
number of integration points and atoms owned.

:line

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a per atom scalar (computational weight) that is
associated with each CAC element and atom in the model.These values are intended
to be used by the variable command in order to provide them to the "fix balance
command"_fix_balance.html

[Restrictions:] requires a CAC atom style to be defined

[Related commands:]

"fix_balance"_fix_balance.html, "variable"_variable.html

[Default:] none
